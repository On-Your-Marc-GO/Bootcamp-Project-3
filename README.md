## Description

If you're like me you'll find that Music is a deeply personal thing that, more often than not invokes things. Thoughts, feelings, ideas. Things that you may want to capture and track. Who knows here inspiration will strike next! The purpose of this application is to take a popular platform that many already use for music and allow for a user to create journal entries associated with songs on playlists they've already created. The entries provided are then saved in a database that will hold all information and allow for the user to revisit/edit as desired should they change their mind on a song. As an additon anybody using the app will be able to play songs in browser with a created webplayer.
